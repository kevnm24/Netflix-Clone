# Netflix Clone

This program looks and feels like Netflix when you first land on the page you will see a featured movie or show. If you refresh the page it will change to a different movie or show every time. All of these movies and shows are being pulled from TMDB (The Movie Database). So the page is constantly being updated with the most recent movies and shows.

Below that you will see categories such as Netflix Originals, Top Rated, Action, etc. You can view more within each category if you hold shift and scroll while hovering on the images. If you click any of the movies it should also show you a trailer. If it doesn’t it’s because the module that was created is having a hard time searching for it.
